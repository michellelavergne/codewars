## How It's Made:      
        
**Tech used:** Plain old Javascript    

All I do is make a new file and add the days kata and push. Rinse and repeat.

## Lessons Learned:

Codewars has definitely been a game changer in the way I've learned to utilize Javascript. It forces you to think creatively and sharpen your googling skills for sure. It has been essential to my learning journey and I'll definitely use it when I learn another language.
